# Portfolio

Converting my portfolio from Static HTML to React

Here are some of things that I learned 

- How to dynamically render the components. I made only one component for a single "Project" and then dynamically passed in data through props
- How to create reusable components that can stand on their own. I made seprate css for each of the components and in addition I made some utilities classes that can be used anywhere g
- How to create animations. I created a separate css file for animations so they can be accessed anywhere.
